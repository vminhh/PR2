a. The program will still work without any issue
   Because because the double data type is capable of holding decimal values
   And Java can able to perform implicit type conversion from double to double.


b. It will result in a compilation error
   Beacause the int data type cannot hold decimal values
   We can use explicit type casting to convert double value to int: int principal = (int) 17000.0;
